# PlantLeafDetection
Detection of Plants by investigating the colors of leaves using the principles of Image Processing
# Colors chosen
RGB: Standard color template found in any image samples
HSV: (Hue, Separation, View) This format provides a different perspective with regards to the hue of the image sample.
YUV: This format leverages the intensity of the colors found in the image sample.
# Training Procedure
Deep CNN models have been chosen for this work. Transfer Learning approach has been leveraged, considering the lesser availability of training image samples.
# Ensembling scheme
The three feature extractors have ensembled, and their performance has been analyzed, based upon several gaussian distribution and fuzzy logic aggregation. The ensembling scheme has been finalised after this procedure.
